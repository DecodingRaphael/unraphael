# Unraphael

**Unraphael** is a digital workflow tool that uses computer vision to unravel the artistic practice of Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio, 1483-1520), while providing new digital approaches for the study of artistic practice in art history. Dozens of faithful reproductions survive of Raphael's paintings, attesting to the lucrative practice of serial production of paintings within the artist's workshop and to the lasting demand for the master's designs. This tool aims to provide new insights into Raphael's working methods through new digital approaches for the study of artistic practice in art history.
