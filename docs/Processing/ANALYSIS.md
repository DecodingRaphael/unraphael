## Estimating the Absolute Area in Paintings Based on Photos

### Background
To verify if the same template was used to produce shapes in different paintings, we need to compare the areas of connected components in the paintings using their photos. Since we only have digital photos and not the physical paintings themselves, we estimate the areas of these components from the photos.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Upload Images and Real Sizes:**
   - **Upload Photos:** Start by uploading the digital photos of the paintings.
   - **Upload Real Sizes:** Upload an Excel file containing the real dimensions of the paintings in centimeters.

2. **Overview of Image Sizes and DPI:**
   - **Check Image Metrics:** Review the sizes and DPI of the uploaded images. This information helps in converting pixel measurements to physical dimensions.

3. **Select and Prepare the Base Image:**
   - **Choose Base Image:** Select a base image for alignment from the uploaded photos.

4. **Equalize Images (Optional):**
   - **Equalize Image Properties:** Adjust the brightness, contrast, and other properties of the images to make them more comparable.

5. **Align Images:**
   - **Choose Alignment Method:** Select an alignment method from various options such as feature-based alignment, enhanced correlation, or others.
   - **Align Images to Base:** Align all images to the chosen base image to ensure consistent size and orientation.

6. **Compute Areas of Connected Components:**
   - **Segment Images:** Use image processing to segment the connected components in each photo.
   - **Calculate Area in Pixels:** Measure the area of the largest connected component in pixels.

7. **Convert Pixel Areas to Physical Dimensions:**
   - **Compute Photo Size in cm:** Convert the size of the photo from pixels to centimeters using the DPI information.
   - **Estimate Scaling Factor:** Determine the scaling factor based on the real dimensions of the painting and the dimensions of the photo.

8. **Calculate Corrected Areas:**
   - **Adjust Areas for Scaling:** Convert the pixel area to the actual size of the painting using the scaling factor.

9. **Compare Areas:**
   - **Compute Area Ratios:** For each pair of paintings, calculate the ratio of their corrected areas.
   - **Check for Similarity:** Compare the ratios to 1.0 to determine if the areas are approximately equal, using a set tolerance for minor discrepancies.

### Detailed Code Overview

- **Compute Size in cm:** Converts pixel dimensions to centimeters based on DPI.
- **Create Mask:** Segments the image to isolate connected components.
- **Calculate Corrected Area:** Adjusts the pixel area to reflect real-world dimensions.
- **Equalize and Align Images:** Ensures consistency in image properties and alignment for accurate analysis.

By following these steps, you can systematically compare the areas of connected components in different paintings, even when only digital photos are available.
